# Path and environment variables

### Path

- In the real world, paths are trails or streets that lead to a certain location. Similarly, in the computer world, a path defines the location of a file or folder in a computer's file system.
- Some examples of root paths include "/" for a Unix root directory, "/Applications/Preview.app" for a Mac OS X application, 
and "D:\venki_chinna\writing-challenge-007-venkichinna" for the Windows application settings. 
- As you can see, Macintosh and Unix systems use forward slashes ( / ) to identify path directories, while Windows uses backslashes ( \ ).
Regardless of the syntax, paths are a simple way to describe the location of folders and files.
 
### Environment Variables 

Operating systems require the environment variables as settings and configurations for several processes although these variables are automatically defined or initialized during the installation of the system or software sometimes these variables are required to be defined manually.   

**_Follow This Steps to Set path for Variables Manually in Windows_**

1. Open Control pannel >>   
2. Select System and Security >>   
3. Select System >>   
4. In the System window, click the Advanced system settings link in the left navigation pane.   
5. In the System Properties window, click the Advanced tab, then click the Environment Variables button near the bottom of that tab.   
6. In the Environment Variables window, highlight the Path variable in the System variables section and click the Edit button.
 Add or modify the path lines with the paths you want the computer to access. Each different directory is separated with a semicolon.
